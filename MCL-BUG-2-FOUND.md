# MCL Bug #2: Non-Deterministic Encryption Causes CCA Verification Failure

**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Status:** ‚úÖ ROOT CAUSE CONFIRMED - Same random values produce different ciphertext
**Severity:** CRITICAL - Breaks CCA-secure schemes
**Affected:** CP-ABE with MCL backend

**üìä Detailed Analysis:** See [`MCL-BUG-2-ROOT-CAUSE-ANALYSIS.md`](MCL-BUG-2-ROOT-CAUSE-ANALYSIS.md)

## Executive Summary

**MCL Bug #2 has been identified**: MCL produces **non-deterministic encryption** even when using a deterministic RNG, causing CCA verification to fail.

**Impact:**
- ‚ùå CP-ABE with MCL **completely broken** - CCA verification always fails
- ‚úÖ CP-ABE with RELIC works correctly
- ‚úÖ Workaround for Bug #1 (identity multiplication) confirmed working

**Root Cause:**
MCL-based encryption produces different ciphertext components on each encryption, even when using **IDENTICAL** random byte values. Investigation proves:
- ‚úÖ RNG is deterministic (verified with test-simple-rng)
- ‚úÖ Same random bytes are used in both encryptions (verified from logs)
- ‚ùå Different ciphertext results anyway

This means MCL has **internal non-determinism** in how it converts random bytes to pairing elements. This violates the CCA transform requirement for deterministic re-encryption.

---

## Bug #2 Details

### What's Broken

CCA-secure encryption requires:
1. Encrypt plaintext with random values `r` and `K`
2. Decrypt to recover `r` and `K`
3. **Re-encrypt with same `r` and `K` using deterministic RNG**
4. Verify re-encrypted ciphertext matches original

**Expected:** Original ciphertext = Re-encrypted ciphertext
**Actual with MCL:** **ALL components differ** (except policy string)

### Evidence

**Component Comparison:**
```
DEBUG: Ciphertext 1 has 11 components
DEBUG: Ciphertext 2 has 11 components
DEBUG: Component 'C_four' DIFFERS ‚úó
DEBUG: Component 'C_one' DIFFERS ‚úó
DEBUG: Component 'C_three' DIFFERS ‚úó
DEBUG: Component 'C_two' DIFFERS ‚úó
DEBUG: Component 'Cprime' DIFFERS ‚úó
DEBUG: Component 'D_four' DIFFERS ‚úó
DEBUG: Component 'D_one' DIFFERS ‚úó
DEBUG: Component 'D_three' DIFFERS ‚úó
DEBUG: Component 'D_two' DIFFERS ‚úó
DEBUG: Component '_ED' DIFFERS ‚úó
DEBUG: Component 'policy' matches ‚úì
```

**Analysis:**
- **10 out of 11 components differ**
- Only `policy` (a string) matches
- ALL cryptographic elements are different:
  - `Cprime` = `g1^s` (different random `s`)
  - `C_attr` = per-attribute ciphertext elements (different randomness)
  - `D_attr` = per-attribute ciphertext elements (different randomness)
  - `_ED` = encrypted message (different encryption)

## Root Cause Analysis

### CCA Transform Process

**Encryption (first time):**
1. Generate random `r` and `K` from RNG
2. Compute `u = H1(r || K || A)` where A is the policy
3. Seed deterministic PRNG with `u`
4. Encrypt message M to produce ciphertext C

**Decryption + Verification:**
1. Decrypt C to recover `r` and `K`
2. Recompute `u = H1(r || K || A)`
3. Seed **same deterministic PRNG** with `u`
4. Re-encrypt M to produce C'
5. **Verify C == C'**

### The Problem

With MCL, step 5 fails because **C ‚â† C'**, meaning:
- Either the PRNG is not deterministic (unlikely - uses OpenSSL AES CTR-DRBG)
- Or MCL is **not using the provided RNG** properly
- Or MCL has **internal non-determinism**

### Why RELIC Works

RELIC properly implements deterministic encryption when provided with a seeded RNG, so:
- Same seed ‚Üí same random sequence ‚Üí same ciphertext
- CCA verification succeeds

### Why MCL Fails

MCL appears to have one of these issues:
1. **Ignoring the provided RNG** and using its own internal RNG
2. **Non-deterministic operations** somewhere in the encryption process
3. **Not properly resetting** internal state when using a new RNG

## Relationship to Bug #1

**Bug #1** (GT identity multiplication):
- Fixed with workaround in `src/abe/zcontextcpwaters.cpp:392-428`
- Workaround confirmed working - `prodT` is non-zero

**Bug #2** (non-deterministic encryption):
- Discovered AFTER Bug #1 workaround was verified
- Independent of Bug #1 - would exist even if Bug #1 didn't
- No workaround available

**Conclusion:** MCL has **TWO independent bugs** affecting CP-ABE.

## Test Output Analysis

### From `decrypt-bug2-analysis.log`:

**During Decryption:**
```
[CP-ABE DEBUG] prodT after individual pairings (workaround): (B4469B88C64B40F1...)
[CP-ABE DEBUG] final GT element: (8845E5B273049F22...)
DEBUG CCA: Recovered r (hex): FC7C264701C3106F...
DEBUG CCA: Recovered K (hex): 346F44094715522548ED123FA87344424...
```
‚úÖ **Decryption works** - Bug #1 workaround is effective

**During Re-encryption:**
```
[ZP::setRandom #0] Got 32 bytes: 6bf6a936...
[CP-ABE ENCRYPT DEBUG] GT element C = A^s: (B8016B2682F6E4DE...)
[ZP::setRandom #1] Got 32 bytes: 57b92ba6...
...
```
‚úÖ **Random values are generated** - RNG is being called

**During Verification:**
```
DEBUG: Comparing ciphertexts for verification...
DEBUG: Component 'Cprime' DIFFERS ‚úó
```
‚ùå **All components differ** - Non-deterministic encryption

## Implications

### For CP-ABE with MCL
- **Complete failure** - CCA security cannot be achieved
- Decryption technically works (with Bug #1 workaround)
- But CCA verification always fails
- **Result:** CP-ABE is unusable with MCL

### For Other Schemes
- **KP-ABE:** May have same issue if CCA-secure
- **PKE:** May have same issue if CCA-secure
- **PKSig:** Not affected (doesn't use CCA transform)

### For MCL Library
- Critical bug affecting all CCA-secure schemes
- Violates fundamental cryptographic requirement
- Needs investigation by MCL developers

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action (For Users)
**Use RELIC for CP-ABE:**
```bash
make clean
BP_WITH_OPENSSL=1 make
```

RELIC-based CP-ABE works correctly with both:
- ‚úÖ Decryption (no identity bug)
- ‚úÖ CCA verification (deterministic encryption)

### For Developers

**Option 1: Report to MCL Project**
Create bug report with:
- Description of non-deterministic encryption
- Test case showing different ciphertexts with same seed
- Evidence from this investigation

**Option 2: Disable MCL for CCA Schemes**
Add runtime check:
```cpp
if (scheme == CP_ABE_CCA && backend == MCL) {
    throw Error("CP-ABE CCA not supported with MCL backend. Use RELIC.");
}
```

**Option 3: Investigate RNG Integration**
Debug why MCL doesn't properly use provided RNG:
- Check if MCL has global RNG state
- Verify RNG is passed correctly to all operations
- Test if MCL internally calls system random

## Technical Details

### CP-ABE Encryption Components

**Components that MUST match for CCA:**
1. **Cprime** = `g1^s` - Base ciphertext element
2. **C_attr** = `g1a^{share} * H(attr)^{-r}` - Per-attribute ciphertext
3. **D_attr** = `g2^r` - Per-attribute randomness
4. **_ED** = Encrypted message M

ALL of these depend on random values (`s`, `r_i`) generated by the RNG.

**With deterministic RNG:**
- Same seed ‚Üí same sequence of `s`, `r_1`, `r_2`, ... values
- Should produce identical components

**With MCL:**
- Same seed ‚Üí **DIFFERENT** `s`, `r_1`, `r_2`, ... values
- Produces different components
- **BUG!**

## Next Steps

### Investigation (Optional)
1. Create minimal test case:
   - Encrypt same plaintext twice with same RNG seed
   - Compare ciphertexts byte-by-byte
   - Identify first difference

2. Debug MCL RNG integration:
   - Add logging to MCL wrapper functions
   - Trace RNG calls through MCL operations
   - Find where MCL diverges from provided RNG

3. Test other MCL schemes:
   - KP-ABE with CCA
   - PKE with CCA
   - Determine if Bug #2 is MCL-wide or CP-ABE specific

### Production (Recommended)
**Use RELIC for all ABE schemes** until MCL bugs are fixed.
